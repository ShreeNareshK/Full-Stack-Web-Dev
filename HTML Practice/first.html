    <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Appearance:</h3> Owls have a distinctive facial disc, which
        helps direct sound to their ears, giving them excellent hearing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Eyes:</h3> Their large, forward-facing eyes provide
        binocular vision, which is great for depth perception. Unlike many
        birds, their eyes are fixed in their sockets, so they must turn their
        heads to look around.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Feathers:</h3> Owls have specialized feathers that help them
        fly silently, aiding in their role as stealthy hunters.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Behavior</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Nocturnal:</h3> Most owls are nocturnal, meaning they are
        active during the night and rest during the day.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Diet:</h3> They are carnivorous and primarily feed on small
        mammals, birds, and insects. Some larger species may also hunt fish.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Hunting:</h3> Owls have excellent hearing and vision, which
        help them locate prey even in low-light conditions. Their powerful
        talons and beaks are used to catch and kill their prey.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Habitat</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Range:</h3> Owls can be found in a variety of habitats,
        including forests, deserts, mountains, and grasslands. They are present
        on every continent except Antarctica.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Nesting:</h3> They often nest in trees, but some species may
        use cliffs, buildings, or burrows.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Species Diversity</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Variety:</h3> There are over 200 species of owls, varying
        greatly in size and appearance. Examples include the tiny Elf Owl and
        the large Eurasian Eagle-Owl.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Distinct Groups:</h3> Owls are divided into two main
        families: the true owls (Strigidae) and the barn owls (Tytonidae).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conservation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Threats:</h3> Many owl species face threats from habitat
        destruction, pollution, and human activities. Some species are
        endangered or vulnerable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Protection:</h3> Conservation efforts include habitat
        preservation, legal protection, and research to better understand owl
        populations and behaviors.
      </li>
    </ul>
